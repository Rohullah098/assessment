# Assessment

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.2.

# Node and VS Code Version
### Node.js: 20.0.0
### VS Code: 1.95
# Tasks and Routes

## The following tasks are implemented and can be accessed via the respective routes:

# TEST 1 - ANGULAR ACTIVITY LIST TO CREATE
### You can access this task via /task1.

# TEST 2 - Angular Landing Page

### You can access this task via /task2.

# TEST 3 - General Website Development
### You can access this task via /task3.

Each task represents a unique feature or functionality, and the UI components for these tasks have been designed as standalone components for reusability.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.




## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.


## Libraries and Dependencies
The project uses the following key dependencies:

### Bootstrap 5.3.3: For UI styling and responsive design. Bootstrap utilities and components are integrated for creating elegant and modern interfaces.
###  TypeScript 5.6.2: Ensures strong typing and modern JavaScript features during development.
### Reusable UI Components
To ensure modularity and reusability, all UI components are created as standalone components. These components can be reused across multiple tasks and parts of the application. Each component encapsulates its styles, templates, and logic, adhering to Angular best practices.

## Examples of Standalone Components
Timeline Component: Used for displaying dynamic timelines with icons and text.
Button Group Component: For grouped button interactions (e.g., icon selection).
Form Components: For handling user input efficiently.
